"Shadow-Fixing Intelligent Canopy" has been one of the METU EE493-EE494 Design Course Projects. Creating a team with 4 partners, i.e. Optima Technologies, I have been one of the designers of an intelligent canopy device that actively
changes position according to the surrounding light sources. Technical design from underneath the canopy can be seen below.

Detailed description of the project and operations can be seen in the "Optima Technologies Design Report". Also, an example view of the cameras of the canopy is shown below.

This output is obtained simply by executing "main.py" file on any computer with 2 connected USB cameras as "VideoDevice(0)" and "VideoDevice(2)". Related information is described in the source code.
